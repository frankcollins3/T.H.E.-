`proposed: loose AI ideas`
user clicks btn -> can now change chart indexes which represent some {keyratio} -> 
AI identifies company & revenue streams, & explains the scenario based on those streams that would have to happen
for the user determined chart UI to reflect in financials to what the user made on the chart: anything they wanted.

(i.e.) -> (me interpreting loosely what AI could say in a case where user dragged revenues[i] on chart up 20-30%):
"Given that AWS is 60% of their profits, in the case you made in the photo you uploaded, Amazon would have to:
increase their retail sales by: x, and given AWS share of profits, increase web services market capture by x"

example OHLC data (open, high, low, close):
{ o: 185, h: 199, l: 184, c: 186, volume: 85354356, date: '5-30-2024', },

ðŸ’¡how effective, reliable would a function that leverages chatGPT API:
:number param -> determines volatility of open,high,low,close

// would be dummy/hypothetical data, NOT: "hey AI can you grab most accurate data of moment or this week of X"
